# SerpApi Implementation for Google Reviews with Owner Replies

## Overview

Successfully integrated SerpApi to get Google Maps reviews WITH owner replies - a feature not available in the public Google Places API.

## What Was Built

### 1. SerpApi Reviews Endpoint
**File**: `server/api/google/serpapi-reviews.get.ts`

- Calls SerpApi's Google Maps Reviews API
- Returns 5 newest reviews with owner replies
- Transforms response to match our format

### 2. Updated Reviews Check
**File**: `server/api/businesses/[id]/checks/google-listing-reviews.ts`

- Tries SerpApi first (includes owner replies)
- Falls back to Places API if SerpApi fails
- Tracks review source (`serpapi` or `places_api`)

### 3. Test Page
**File**: `app/pages/test-serpapi.vue`

- Simple UI to test SerpApi integration
- Shows reviews with owner replies
- Default Place ID: Kaak Medisch Centrum

### 4. Environment Configuration
**File**: `.env`

- Added `SERPAPI_KEY` configuration
- Your API key is configured and ready

## API Response Format

### SerpApi Response Structure
```json
{
  "reviews": [
    {
      "user": {
        "name": "John Doe"
      },
      "rating": 5,
      "snippet": "Great service!",
      "date": "2 weeks ago",
      "response": {
        "snippet": "Thank you for your feedback!",
        "date": "1 week ago"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Our Transformed Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "source": "serpapi",
  "count": 5,
  "reviews": [
    {
      "author": "John Doe",
      "rating": 5,
      "text": "Great service!",
      "date": "2 weeks ago",
      "ownerReply": {
        "text": "Thank you for your feedback!",
        "date": "1 week ago"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

### Flow
1. Business report page loads
2. Reviews check calls `/api/google/serpapi-reviews?placeId=...`
3. SerpApi endpoint fetches reviews from SerpApi
4. Response includes owner replies in `response` field
5. Data is transformed to our format
6. UI displays reviews with owner reply badges

### Fallback Strategy
```typescript
try {
  // Try SerpApi (includes owner replies)
  const serpApiResult = await $fetch(`/api/google/serpapi-reviews?placeId=...`)
  reviews = serpApiResult.reviews
} catch (error) {
  // Fall back to Places API (no owner replies)
  reviews = placesApiReviews
}
```

## Testing

### Test Page
Visit `/test-serpapi` to test the integration:
1. Default Place ID is already set (Kaak Medisch Centrum)
2. Click "Test SerpApi"
3. See reviews with owner replies

### Expected Results
- ✅ 5 newest reviews
- ✅ Owner replies included
- ✅ Badge showing "✓ Has Reply" or "No Reply"
- ✅ Source badge showing "serpapi"

## Cost & Limits

### SerpApi Pricing
- **Free Tier**: 100 searches/month
- **Starter**: $50/month - 5,000 searches

### Our Usage

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "SERPAPI_KEY not configured"
