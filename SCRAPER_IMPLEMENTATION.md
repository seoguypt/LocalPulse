# Google Reviews Scraper Implementation

## Summary

I've implemented a Puppeteer-based web scraper to extract Google Maps reviews with owner replies, since this data is not available through the public Google Places API.

## What Was Built

### 1. Scraper API Endpoint
**File**: `server/api/google/scrape-reviews.post.ts`

- Launches headless Chrome browser
- Navigates to Google Maps place page
- Scrolls to load reviews
- Extracts review data including owner replies
- Returns structured JSON data

### 2. Integration with Reviews Check
**File**: `server/api/businesses/[id]/checks/google-listing-reviews.ts`

- First calls Places API for basic data
- Then calls scraper to get reviews with owner replies
- Falls back to API reviews if scraping fails
- Adds `hasOwnerReplies` flag to response

### 3. Updated UI
**File**: `app/pages/[id]/index.vue`

- Updated to handle both API and scraped review formats
- Displays owner replies with special styling
- Shows badges indicating reply status
- Compatible with both data sources

### 4. Test Page
**File**: `app/pages/test-scraper.vue`

- Simple UI to test the scraper
- Enter any Place ID and see results
- Shows reviews with owner replies highlighted

### 5. Documentation
**File**: `docs/SCRAPER.md`

- Complete documentation of the scraper
- API reference
- Deployment considerations
- Maintenance guidelines

## How to Use

### Test the Scraper
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/test-scraper`
3. Enter a Place ID (default is Google Sydney)
4. Click "Test Scraper"

### In Production
The scraper is automatically called when viewing a business report:
1. Go to any business report page
2. Click on "Google Listing Reviews" check
3. Reviews with owner replies will be displayed

## Data Structure

### Scraped Review Format
```typescript
{
  author: string
  rating: number
  text: string
  date: string
  ownerReply?: {
    text: string
    date: string
  }
}
```

## Key Features

✅ Extracts owner replies (not available in Places API)
✅ Automatic fallback to API data if scraping fails
✅ Compatible with existing UI
✅ Test page for debugging
✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Limitations

⚠️ **Performance**: 5-10 seconds per request (vs <1s for API)
⚠️ **Reliability**: Depends on Google Maps DOM structure
⚠️ **Deployment**: May not work on Cloudflare Workers (use Node.js)
⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: Too many requests may trigger anti-bot measures

## Deployment Notes

### Works On:
- ✅ Local development
- ✅ VPS/dedicated servers
- ✅ Docker containers
- ✅ Vercel/Netlify (with Node.js runtime)

### May Not Work On:
- ❌ Cloudflare Workers (standard Puppeteer)
- ❌ Serverless with strict timeouts (<10s)

### For Cloudflare Workers:
Use `@cloudflare/puppeteer` (already in package.json) which provides a browser API compatible with Workers.

## Alternative Solutions

If scraping becomes problematic:

1. **Google My Business API** - Requires business ownership + OAuth
2. **SerpApi** - Paid service ($50-200/month)
3. **Outscraper** - Another paid scraping service
4. **Manual Entry** - Let users indicate if they reply to reviews

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `server/api/google/scrape-reviews.post.ts` - Scraper endpoint
- `app/pages/test-scraper.vue` - Test page
- `docs/SCRAPER.md` - Documentation
- `SCRAPER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

### Modified:
- `server/api/businesses/[id]/checks/google-listing-reviews.ts` - Added scraper integration
- `app/pages/[id]/index.vue` - Updated to handle scraped review format

## Important Notes

### TypeScript Errors
You may see TypeScript errors in `scrape-reviews.post.ts` about `document` not being found. These are **false positives** - the code inside `page.evaluate()` runs in the browser context where `document` is available. The `@ts-ignore` comment suppresses these at runtime.

### Google Maps DOM Structure
The scraper uses multiple fallback strategies to find reviews since Google Maps uses dynamic class names and frequently changes their HTML structure. If reviews aren't being found:

1. Check the console logs for "Found X review elements"
2. The scraper tries 3 different selector strategies
3. You may need to update selectors if Google changes their structure

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real data**: Try different Place IDs
2. **Monitor performance**: Check scraping success rate
3. **Adjust selectors**: If Google changes their HTML
4. **Consider caching**: Cache scraped reviews to reduce load
5. **Add rate limiting**: Prevent abuse of scraper endpoint
