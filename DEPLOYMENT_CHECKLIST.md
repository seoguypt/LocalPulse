## ðŸŽ‰ Launch!

Once all items are checked, you're ready to share your app!

**Your live URL:** `https://your-app.vercel.app`

---

## ðŸ“Š Usage Monitoring

Check these regularly to stay within free tiers:

- **Vercel**: Dashboard â†’ Analytics (bandwidth usage)
- **Neon**: Dashboard â†’ Usage (storage, compute time)
- **Google Places**: Cloud Console â†’ APIs & Services â†’ Quotas
- **SerpAPI**: Dashboard â†’ Usage (searches remaining)
- **Browserless**: Dashboard â†’ Usage (requests remaining)

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Check Vercel function logs (real-time)
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test database connection
5. Check API key limits/quotas
6. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) troubleshooting section

Good luck! ðŸš€
